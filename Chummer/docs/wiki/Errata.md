### Note on Statuses: 
I've been thinking about the status lines I'm putting in the entries as I start posting things. I have three in my head. Here's what they mean at the moment; this is subject to change as things move forward and I get my sea legs under me. Generally speaking, green is good and red is bad.  
  
**Provisional:** This means the team and I have come up with a solution that hasn't been addressed in other forms (older errata, errata items from the French or German licenses, a note from Jason saying "Fix this, please," that sort of thing). It's an official ruling, but it's out on a test drive, and if enough people notice something wrong, we reserve the right to fix it before we send it up the line for posting on the errata page on the website, or when getting ready for a reprint. If nothing has happened to it by then, it becomes Official. Speaking of which....  
  
**Official:** If something we're working on has been published in a foreign edition, or handed down from Jason, or it's a typo fix, it'll generally bypass the Provisional stage and go straight to Official. This tag will generally include a source, such as "Jason M. Hardy" (as happened with the recent correction to the _Court of Shadows_ credit listing), or "German edition" or something along those lines.  
  
**Superseded:** When I compile the errata sheets, as they get added on, Provisional tags will be changed to Official. Once something is listed as Official, it can still be changed (we're still fallible), but it might be a more drawn-out process. Sometimes, too, Provisional items might be flawed and the team and I have to back to the drawing board. Either way, when something changes, a new Provisional item will be created, and the one it's replacing will be marked Superseded. This tag will be followed by a link to the new item.

You’ll want a commlink (p. 438) to stay in touch and to keep your gear relatively safe from hackers. A fake SIN (p. 442), along with some fake licenses, will help smooth dealing with law enforcement or even simple purchases like buying a bus ticket or covering a bar tab.
